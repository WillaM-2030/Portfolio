        <p>Coding is writing commands in 
            a programming language to make a computer 
            perform specific functions. It can involve
             skills like understanding programming 
             languages, critical thinking, logic and 
             focus. I like spending time on this beacuse 
             it is a great
              way to decompress myself outside 
               work, but it can also help increasing
                 cognitive and creative abilities
                 and lets me practice and explore more
                 on coding skills. 
                </p>
                <p>Imagine developing this 
                    website i used my best hobby. Coding! Very nice!</p>
    

        <li><h3>Playing keyboard</h3></li>

      <p>Keyboard playing is another mervelous stuff i really
        enjoy plyaing. It requires good memory skills and cretivity. It 
        is more or less coding, in that we do chording to make it sound
        proper proffesional.
        I just like striking the various white and black notes.

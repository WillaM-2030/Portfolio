        <p style="background-color: rgb(133, 221, 228); border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 8px 2px rgb(67, 67, 175);width: 270px;">Coding is writing commands in 
            a programming language to make a computer 
            perform specific functions. It can involve
             skills like understanding programming 
             languages, critical thinking, logic and 
             focus. I like spending time on this beacuse 
             it is a great
              way to decompress myself outside 
               work, but it can also help increasing
                 cognitive and creative abilities
                 and lets me practice and explore more
                 on coding skills. I have best skills in MySQL, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Visual Basic, Javascript 
                 and having more space for gaining skills on other nice 
                languages like Python, PHP, React and many more! </p>

        <p style="background-color: rgb(188, 241, 241); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 9px 3px rgb(226, 131, 43); width: 370px; border-left: 10px; border-color: greenyellow;">Networking is
             the process of connecting computers, or nodes to a network 
            in order for communication, resource sharing and even 
            to provide security to the nodes.
        I do network desingin, I have the best knowledge
    designing it using the the software called Circuit Packet
Tracer. This software enable you to design and even 
configure any network with a lot of ease. When mentioning networking, 
the techinicall skills such as cable management, cable crimmping
and even network configuration is a key thing to concider.
Setting up the networking devices like 
switches, routers, hubs and gateways is something I really 
enjoy doing.  Since a network can be either connected 
wirelessly or using the wired media, having the superb knowledge
in wireless connectivity is also something very substancial.
I'm highly skilled in this section in IT field!</p>

        <h3 style="color: rgb(202, 55, 87); background-color: rgb(76, 0, 255);width: 380px; text-align: center;">Web Development</h3>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(188, 241, 208); border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 9px 3px blueviolet; width: 370px;"> Having the knowledge in scripting language and 
            stlying the webstite, desingning and developing 
            websites is so amazing! CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) is
             used for the websites aesthetic purposes while 
             Hypeprtext Markup Language (HTML) is 
             used for the structural building of
              the website, in addition, functionality
               and responsiveness of the website is
                also essential, to achieve this, 
                a scripting language, JavaScript (Js) 
            is a great tool to accomplish this mission.
            Sometimes Websties are required to to more and more 
            comlicated
             tasks such as to store the data from either forms 
             filled, this 
             easilly achieved by the power of PHP which is
              capable of linking
              the requested datatypes and variables
               to the database, this linkage wont work alone with PHP, 
               so a Stuctured Query Language (SQL) must be included for proper functionality. Having Diploma in ICT for 
               a period of three years, I believe this job suits me the most!
